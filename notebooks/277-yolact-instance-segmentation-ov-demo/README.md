Instance segmentation is a crucial computer vision task that aims to detect and precisely delineate individual objects within an image, providing pixel-level segmentation masks for each instance. Unlike object detection, instance segmentation enables fine-grained localization and boundary understanding, opening up diverse applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, among others.
